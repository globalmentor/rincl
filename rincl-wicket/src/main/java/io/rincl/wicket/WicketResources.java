 * Even though {@link Localizer} provides access to resources from arbitrary locales, in the Rincl model {@link Resources} provides resources to a single
 * locale. Thus this implementation uses its stored locale via {@link #getLocale()} to determine the resources to retrieve from the {@link Localizer}. Consumers
 * of this class should therefore retrieve new resources as needed as the {@link Resources} implementation will not change locale as dynamically.
