/**
 * Strategy for loading resource bundles from properties files stored in standard properties format but using the UTF-8 charset by default, or any UTF-*

 * This implementation recognizes files with the extension {@value #FILENAME_EXTENSION}, stored in the format specified in {@link Properties#load(Reader)}.

 * This implementation is not meant for normal registration, but is used directly by the Rincl resource bundle control to improve Java properties file loading.
